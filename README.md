# MTClicker

## Introduction
MTClicker was designed and created by Jimmy Hoang and Harry Li as a project for Lighthouse Labs.  The objective of the game
is to collect as many coins as possible by tapping on the screen.  There are two types of upgrades available for purchase, 
items and buildings.  Items multiply your base tap income by a certain amount, meanwhile buildings provide decoration for
the farm and various animals as well.  Coins can also be spent to level up the yourself, which will also increase the 
base tap income.

## Design Process
Jimmy was responsible for the back-end data models and logic, meanwhile Harry was in charge of all animations, UI aspects,
and income alogorithms.
